# Interview Cake Clojure Solutions
This repository contains most solutions (32/44), with corresponding unit tests, for the problems defined on [interview cake](https://www.interviewcake.com). The solutions are implemented in Clojure as idiomatically as possible and attempt to follow the guidelines outlined in the [clojure-style-guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide).

Some problems are left uncompleted either because they are mostly theoretical, discussion based, or don't fit nicely with Clojure (eg. problems dealing purely with mutation).

## Running The Problems
Each problem is defined as its own self contained Clojure leiningen project. First make sure to have [leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) installed.
Then after cloning the main repo, `cd` into the directory of the problem and either run the unit tests with `lein test` or launch the Clojure REPL with `lein repl`.


## Contributing
Contributions are very welcome! Please feel free to open an issue or pull request if you find a bug or think there is a better way to solve one of the problems solved above.
